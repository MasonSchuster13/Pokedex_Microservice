<h2>REQUEST HANDLING</h2>
<p>The microservice uses get, post, and delete functions to request data.<p/>
<P>This is done using the local host server at port 3001.</P>
<p>Example get request: const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/pokemon')</p>
<h2>RESPONSE HANDLING</h2>
<p>When the app receives a response from the microservice (in the form of a json object) it simply displays the information to the user in a neat manner.</p>
